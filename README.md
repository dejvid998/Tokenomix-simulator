# Tokenomix Simulator – Tokenomics Modeling & Simulation Platform for Solana Projects  

An open-source platform to help Solana builders design, simulate, and optimize tokenomics models with **real-time visualizations**, **data exports**, and **community-driven insights**.  

> 🚀 Built by [Resomnium](https://linktr.ee/ResomniumConsultsMe) | [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/ae162258-420b-4050-8e5d-86f0776de6b0)
## 🌐 Overview  

Designing sustainable tokenomics is one of the biggest challenges for Web3 founders, DAOs, and Solana-based projects.  
Most existing tools are either **too technical** or require deep **financial expertise**, leading to:  

- Poorly designed token economies  
- Failed launches and weak community trust  
- Difficulty raising funding  

**Tokenomix Simulator** solves this by providing a **user-friendly**, **open-source** platform for Solana builders to model, test, and share tokenomics strategies.
